# Boston House Price Prediction & Rock Paper Scissors Projects

Welcome to my project repository! Here you'll find two of my major projects that showcase my skills in both data science and classic game development:

## 1. Boston House Price Prediction

**Description:**  
A machine learning project that predicts house prices in Boston using various features such as number of rooms, crime rate, and more. This project utilizes the Boston Housing dataset and demonstrates data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and deployment.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts
- (Optional) Flask/FastAPI for web deployment

**Features:**
- Data cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Model building using regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation and visualization
- (Optional) Web app for user input and price prediction

**How to Run:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python packages:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook/script to train and test the model.
4. (Optional) Launch the web app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
5. Enter house features to get a predicted price!

## 2. Rock Paper Scissors

**Description:**  
A classic Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. Implemented in multiple languages for practice, including Python, Java, and JavaScript. Features both command-line and web-based interfaces.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python / Java / JavaScript
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web version)
- (Optional) GUI frameworks (Tkinter, JavaFX)

**Features:**
- Playable in terminal or browser
- Score tracking and replay option
- User-friendly interface

**How to Run:**

### Python Version:
1. Navigate to the `rock-paper-scissors/python` directory.
2. Run:
   ```
   python rps.py
   ```

### Java Version:
1. Navigate to the `rock-paper-scissors/java` directory.
2. Compile and run:
   ```
   javac RPS.java
   java RPS
   ```

### Web Version:
1. Open `rock-paper-scissors/web/index.html` in your browser.
